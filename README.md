# Introduction

> STT: Speech-To-Text

The CommonVoice FR project uses üê∏-STT ‚Äã‚Äã([Coqui-STT](https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT)), the following implementation from the [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla) project from the Mozilla Foundation, to continue transforming sound waves into text based on the learning algorithm proposed by the community.

# Canals

- **CommonVoice-rm** uses the **Common Voice** channel on Matrix for discussion and coordination: [register to the group](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#common-voice-en:mozilla.org)
